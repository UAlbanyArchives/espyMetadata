In 188h he moved to Seals, Russell 00., Ala., where he obtained work as a farm laborer. Shortly afterwards, he brought his ﬁIKEXKXﬁXE mistress there from Columbus and even though they ﬁﬂﬁﬁXXﬁgXIXXXﬂXKﬁXﬁH went through a marriage ceremony after their arrival in Seals, they did.not live together. Instead, he rented a house about two miles from.the farm where he was employed and she stayed there with him visiting her frequently. Davis began having an affair with the sister of another young white man in the area, Archi- bald Reems, and when Reems learned about the situtation, he remonstra- ted.with Davis and told him to_st0p seeing his sister as he was a married man. In September, 1885, Davis waylaid Reems in the woods and shot him in the back with both barrels of a shotgun loaded with squirrel shot. He then went over to where Reems lay wounded and.whi1e his victim pleaded for his life, saying that if he was Spared he would  swear that he had been shot by an accident and not involve Davis in any way, Davis drew his knife and out Reems‘ throat so deeply that  his head was almost severed from his body. Ie then bludgeoned the  corpse so violently that the stock of his gun was broken. ‘Davis NENYYURK TIMES; New York, N. Y., June 29, 1836 » attempted to drag the body to the river but the task was too great for him and he went to the home of black man who lived nearby, told him what he had done and promised him Reems' boots if he would drags the body to the river and throw it in. Believing that the black man was disposing of the corpse, Davis went to the homeeof Reems' mother and told her that her son had been involved in some difficulty had had to leave the area for a few days. He explained that he had been sent to get some food and clothing which the old woman gave to him. Davis returned to the_scene of the murder to be certain that the body had been consigned to the river and there found the black man and one of his friends who he had summoned. Once again Davis admitted killing Reems and justified his action by saying that Reems had falsely accused him of stealing a load of oats. He then wandered off into the woods and managed to escape capture for two days after which he was taken into custody and eharged.with the murden. He never denied his guilt though he continued to maintain that the murder had occurred because of false accusations of theft and he was convicted and sentenced to die. At his execution at Seals on June 26, 1886, he made a speech from the gallows in which he confessed murdering Reems in anger and warned other young men not to marry more than once and not to tell ,women'ﬁﬁxxiﬁ.that they loved them unless it was true. he closed his ytalk by saying: ""I hepe my death will save ten thousand."|False|f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585

Nichols, a 37-year-old white man, was a Carpenter who lived on his father‘s farm four miles south of Pine Bluff, Jefferson County, Ark. In 1902 he was commissioned to construct a gallows on the county poor farm and ironically he became the third man to be put to death on it ten years later. In addition to building the gallows, 1902 was an eventful year for him in that he was married to his wife, Minnie, and they set up housekeeping in a house directly across the road from that of his parents. Even though their domestic relations were not happy, they became the parents of two girls and'a boy and there is evidence that, in addition to showling little affection for her Children, Mrs. Nichols had frequently expressed the wish that they were dead. In 1910 they separated and she moved into town. Divorce action was pending and Nichols was granted custody of the children though she was ordered by the court to be allowed to have them for two days each week. On Sunday morning, Sept. 16, 1911, she arrived at the Nichols farm in a buggy, accompanied by a woman friend. Shé and Nichols went into the house that they had formerly occupied and talked for about one hour.  Wheg theyreturned to the bu gy, she asked him if the children were rea y to go. 1e went onto txe porch of his father 5 house and called the children and the two girls went to their mother. The youngest  child, a 2~year~old boy, crawled int; 2&5 father’s lap and.began crying W / saying that he did not wish to go. Mrs. Nichols insisted and When Nichols told her to leave the children there until the next Friday, she pulled the boy from his lap. He then rose from his chair and, in view of her friend, cut her throat, inflicting a fatal wound. At his trial, Nichols claimed that the crime had occurred in a fit of passion and even though there was considerable sympathy for him, he was con- victed and sentenced to die. The conviction was affirmed by the Arkan— sas Supreme Court on appeal and then a petition signed.by over 1,000 citizens was sent to the Governor asking for a commutation of the death sentence. A committee from Pine Bluff went to Little Rock and pleaded.with the Governor in person but he declined to interfere and Nichols was hanged on the gallows that he had constructed ten years previously on June 7, 1912. Early on the morning of his execution, he was visited in his cell by his father, his brother, his brother-in-law, children and three nieces and nephews.'

After his release, he traveled around the country and in 1920. under the alias of Charles Smith, he was sentenced to a term of from.one~to-fourteen years in an Illinois prison for grand larceny. In.l930 he was arrested in a craps game in little Rock, Ark.. for possession of narcotics and when his fingerprints were found to match those of a man who had committed several burglaries in Jefferson 00., he was sent there and, following his trial and conviction, sentenced to nine years imprisonment. Ie escaped from a State Prison farm on March 30. 1932. and returned to Little Rock. On April 15, armed with two pistols which he had previously stolen, he entered through the rear of the Black and.White food store located on Twelfth and Welsh Streets. After forcing the butcher into a refrigerator, he summoned the manager to the rear and ordered him inside the cooler also. He then went to the front and was in the process of taking the money from the register when Carthel H. Atwood, the 20-year-old produce clerk who was unaware that a robbery was in progress, suddeniry rose from his  seated.position in the produce section. Without warning, Williams ‘ fired and killed him. He then fled through the front door but was seen  by several passersby who knew him and provided his name to the police. Less than three hours later, he was cornered near Ninth and College XXET Streets and, when he fired at the officers, he was shot four times with one of the bullets breaking his leg. After he had been taken to a hos~ pital for treatment, he was taken to the State Prison for safekeeping. Shortly afterwards, a number of men ﬁiﬁﬁXﬁﬁ went to the hospital and demanded admission to his room. When it was explained to them that he had been moved, they left. Later five men went to the Prison and said that they were Sheriffsa Deputies who had been sent to take him into custody but an actual deputy who was in the office at the time denied this and they then said that they only wanted to ""see"" him for a few minutes.

Badlwin's story waspt at two Mexicans  had attacked Mrs. Morris and her daughter and that, when he went to their rescue, he was cut. He narrowly missed being lynched before he could be gotten away from the campsite to the jail at Globe and  a mob formed there with the intent of taking the law into their own hands and this was prevented only by the courageous action of a local judge and the sheriff and his deputies.

He heard rumors to the effect that John Hayden and Ralph Hart, both 63-years-old, who lived in a house on the site of old Menracken mine in the northwest- ern part of YUma County had stnuck it rich and secreted over $500, 000 in gold. He returned to New York and convinced two friends, Daniel O'Connell and William EXKEXKXX Daughty, that the two elderly men could be easily robbed and they accompanied him back to Arizona. , During the first week in February, 1933, Hayden and Hart disappeared and a friend notified the Sheriff of Yuma county. A search of their residence revealed that it had been ransacked and that four guns as well as other personal possessions were missing; After a several  day search, their bodies, both shot in the back, were found buried in a shallow grave. Investigations showed.that Douglas, woo had been living in Phoenix, and two-other men, both strangers, had been in the area, staying in a deserted cabin, at the time of the disappearance of the miners and their movements were traced. During the investi- gation, the four weapons stolen from the dead men's home, were re- covered, two of them having been pawned by Douglas and the other two by Daughty. All three were'trahed to New York City and.arrested there on February 16. Both Daughty and O'Connell made complete confessions, stating that Douglas had invited the two men over to their camp and that when Hayden and Hart had started.to leave, he had shot them both in the back. Daughty and O'Connell, saying that Douglas had assured. them that there would be no violence, admitted that they had helped to bury the bodies. An intensive search of the dead men’s home and the surrounding area failed to reveal any trace of the supposed $SOOIOOO, and the two men had returned to New York.

After his release, “he moved to Arizona where he ab- tained work as a laborer on the Bradley Ranch near Perryville, Mari~ copa Co. He was in the ranch mess hall one night in early Oct., 1937, when he heard Charles Goade, an elderly laborer brag that he owned a prosperous.mining claim.in the mountains. When the other workers be- gan kidding the old man, Goade drew an old tobacco bag from his pock- et and displayed a roll of bills containing several hundred dollars. Goade, something of an eccentric, lived in a cabin about two miles from the other workers and, during the warm nights slept outside in  a cotton wagon. On the night of Oct. 12, Odom ran across the fields to Goade‘s cabin and, while Goade lay in the wagon sleeping, bludgeon- _ed him to death with an iron grate to an outdoor fire place. He then ran back to the main camp and feigned having a heart attack, summon- ing other laborers to his assistance and sending one of them for a bottle of brandy to ""revive"" him. Goade's body was discovered the  next morning and when officers learned about his having flashed.the roll of bills in the mess hell, they immediately suspected.that ano—  ther laborer had killed him. Odom's appposed heart attack gave him those who had gone to his assistance “a seemingly ironclad alibi and. all of the other laborers were able to furnish satisfactory accounts of there whereabouts. A few days later, Odom's girl friend attended a dance wearing a new $70.00 dress and when she was questioned as to where she had obtained the money for the purchase, she told the offi~ cers that Odom had given it to her. As the cost of the dress amounts. to more than one month's wages, the officers checked Edom's backgroun- and learned that he had been a long distance runner and could possibly have covered the distance from the main camp to Goade's cabin, killed and robbed him and returned to the canp. When questioned, he con- féssed after the officers told him that the girl had told them that he gave her the money for the dress and admitted.that he had faked the heart attack to provide himself with an alibi. ht his trial he was convicted and sentenced to die and, as there was no appeal, he was aSphyxiated.at the nrizona State Prison on January 1h,‘l938.

He hid in the washroom of the rear Pullman car until the train left the station and then, with a revolver, robbed the brakeman, the conductor and eight passengers of their money and jewel- ry. Another passenger named Horace E. Montague entered the car carry~ ing his valise and when he approached Bostic, he was told to raise his hands and hand over his valuables. Montague refused to comply and dropped his grip as though he meant to offer resistance and Bostic shot him. Montague then fled in the opposite direction and fell mor- tally wounded before he reached the door.

There were no clues and Bostic was not a suspect in any way, but on Dec. 2h he was seen  in San Francisco by a woman who had been in the car and robbed by him and she notified authorities who took him into custody. 6n the train trip to Los Angeles, he made a complete confession of the robbery-mur- der and at his trial he entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to hang by a judge nix: who did not tagg'any testimony.

Something of a loner, Busch lived in an apartment and his closest contacts away from his work were with various older women who he had known and who had.befriended him since his early child- hood.

Originally good friends, Smith had asked Clifton to move into the house and he had lived there for several weeks before he and Smith  got into an argument over Clifton's spreading red pepper about the dwelling for the purpose of keeping out ""evil spirits."" Four a couple of days, relations between the two became more strained with Smith accusing Miss Fisher of giving HEX money that he had earned to Clif- ton and finally telling her that if Clifton did not leave the house, he would do so. Around 1:30 on the afternoon of April 9, 1920, they both were drinking and began arguing. In the KXKK fight which ensued, Clifton slashed a nineuinch gash across Smith's abdomen, severing som. of his intestines, and stabbed him twice in the arm. He then left th house and was arrested shortly afterwards leaning against a fence. Smith.was unconscious when help arrived and he was taken to a hospital where he died without regaining consciousness. Clifton, though intox  icated, made a statement at the police station intwgicghhﬁ gaid that ‘ k . d Ni 5 isher and admitted t a mi a no wea- Egﬁwagaéhérétﬁe 8¥e€h5‘ igg . At his trial, he maintained self~de~ ﬁshes and claimed that Smith had attacked him first. Two witnesses who had entered the room during the fight, said that Smithwwas not f armed and had been severely cut and was bleeding and pleading with Clifton not to cut him anymore. His conviction was affirmed on appea but then the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and two of the Asso- ciate Justices recommended to the Governor that the sentence be conmuu ~ted to life imprisonment on the grounds that premeditation was not proven. This plea for clemency was joined in by the State Advisory Pardon Board and Clifton received three reprieves before the Governor decided not to conmmte the sentence. In a statement, Governor Stem phens said that he had carefully reviewed the case and was convinced that Clifton was guilty of ”an atrocicious, premeditated murder."" Is also received an affidavit that he had received from a Sacramento doctor who said that he had attended a black man who was a witness in the case on the morning of the homicide and had seen Clifton whetting ~ his knife. He said that Clifton declared: ""I have quite a job on hand and need a good, sharp knife."" Clifton was reconciled to his fate and on the night before his execution, he ate a hearty supper and slept well. The next morning, he ate a good breakfast and went to his death with a prayer on his lips and without any display of emotion. is was hanged at Folsom Prison on October 21, 1921.  1 8 PACIFIC 106 - .

Creeks, considered a trustworthy prisoner, was assigned a job as inmate counter and in this position he managed to attain make an impression of the key to their cell door and Flash used this to fashion a key from an old spoon. On the evening of Oct. 16, l9lh, they unlocked the door and waited in the corridor for Night Ser- geant John Drury and Guard_Joreph Kerr to make their rounds. ‘When they entered.the block, Flash attacked Drury knocking him to the ground and  fatally stabbing him with a prison made knife while Creeks attacked.

Dessauer, a Bqueareold native of New York with a withered arm, left his wifarand moved to Los Angeles because he aspired to become a screen writer. His literary talents were limited and he failed in his aspirations to break into the big time. He did, however, meet  a beautiful divorcee, Mrs. Iibby Bershatsky, who lived in an apart- ment with her lZiyear-old daughter, and they soon became lovers. Dessauer moved in with Mrs. Bershatsky and they lived it up as far as their limited means would allow. Life was a frustrating ordeal for the lovers because both desired the finer things in life even though they could not afford them and ﬁﬁlxﬁﬁﬁ and they alternated between periods of elation with their relationship and depression because of their limited financial circumstances. During their periods oﬂ depression, they frequently discussed joint suicide and much of their conversations had a definite morbid twist. On April 2, 1951, Dessauer parked the car in which they were riding on a busy street and they talked for about an hour. When Mrs. Bershatsky turned her head to look out of a window, he shot her three times in the back of the head and left the car. Strangely enough, no one heard the gunshots and it was not until some time later that a passerby noticed a trickle of blood and notified the police. Dessauer ‘ had in the meantime gone to a restaurant, eaten a good meal and penned a complete confession. He then calls d the police, told them what had happened and asked them to come and pick him up. He made virtually no fight for his life, maintaining that he wanted to die as that would complete the suicide pact about which they had talked so often. His attorney entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and he was tried before a judge without a jury. The prosecution maintained that the case was one of premedita tion because Mrs. Bershatsky had been on an extensive shopping trip” the day that she was killed and this certainly did not indicate her knowledge of a suicide pact.  After he was sentenced to die, Dessauer became known as the glutton of death row at San Quentin because of his enormous appetite. His last meal was one of the largest ever requested mm by a condemned man, and after he had finished eating it he requested a whole stalk of bananas which he munched on all night.

He deserted the Army six weeks later and made his way to New Orlenas from whence he caught a ship to New York. There he joined the Navy and was assigned to man-o-war. In 18h8 he deserted his ship in San Francisco to go to the gold fields but was captured two weeks later and received 200 lashes as punishment. When his ship went to Valparaiso, he jumped ship again and returned to San Francisco on board a British vessel. From there he went to Sacramento and Marysville where he worked, generally as  a cook. In May, 1855, he was employed as a bartender in Sacramento by David C. Goodwin. Goodwin convinced him to accompany him to the mines in Shasta County and they went to a place called Horsetown where Goodwin purchased a cabin and they began mining Operations in partnership. They were unsuccessful in their mining endeavors and Higgins, who was destitute, wanted tor~eturn to Sacramento but Good» win inSisted on their working their claim.

LEHEW, Thomas  Lchew, a 32-year~old White woodchOpper, lived with his sister and brother-invlaw just outside the city limits of Mendocino, Calif. On the afternoon of May 23, 1929, he waylaid 7-year-old Theresa Johnson, the daughter of a neighbor, as she was returning home from school, dragged her into some bushes by the side of the road, raped her and strangled her to death. When the child did not reach home after leaving the school bus, a search party was formed with Lehew as a par~ ticipant and the body was discovered just before dark. Lehew became  a suspect because of inconsistencies in his accounts of his activities that afternoon, and scrapings from his finger-nails as well as the clothing that he had worn were sent to the Berkeley Crime Laboratory for analysis. The analysis revealed that the dirt from the scrapings matched dirt at the spot where the body was found; that bloodstains  on his underlothing matched that of the dead girl; and that traces of a blue dye found on her clothing matched the dye on the overalls that ,ehew was wearing. Tracks that matched the shoes that he were were also found from where he claimed to have been cutting wood to the  scene of the crime Lehew finally confessed that he he has .

He shot and wounded a man with whom he had been having relations in Montana and was sen- tenced to the State Prison where his cellamate was Louis E. Jette, a1 so white, who was fourteen years younger. A homosexual relationship soon developed between them and it continued until Lininger was re- leased. He managed to secure a parole for his lover and went to work on the Montana farm where Jette lived with his parents. The family soon discovered the relationship existing between their son and Lin- inger and Jette placed all of the blame on Lininger. Jette left and went to Tehama Co., Calif., where he obtained employment. Iininger followed and on the night of Sept. 25, l9hO, he smeared cyanide poi- son on Jette as he lay sleeping and left the open can in the room. Lininger fled to Bedding where, he subsequently said, he planned to kill himself by the same method but didnot have the courage to do so. He was cornered at a Bedding automobile court and shot and wounded  while being arrested. At his trial, Lininger pleaded guilty and his attorney sought a life sentence. Lininger maintained that e had  killed Jette because Jette had said that he would seek out Liningerc ywife, then living in Alaska, and his daughter, than living in Texas, and force them to have unnatural sexual relations with him. The conviction and sentence of death was affirmed by the California Su— preme Court. While on death row, Lininger became fast friends with another condemned man, Eldon Hawk,and converted Hawk to the Episco» palian faith, his own. Hawk requested and received a respite of three weeks in order that they might die together and on August 29, l9hl, both were asphyxiated at San Quentin Prison.

In August, 1959, he was on prdbation for burglary and car theft and was driving a stolen Pontiac with stolen plates in Hillsborough, Calif. Officer Eugene A.  ‘ Doran, 38~years-old, stopped him when a check revealed that the license plate on the car was stolen and, as Doran frisked him, Rebi- llard pulled a pistol that he had concealed and shot the officer: six times in the face and abdomen. Because the weapon used was a .32 caliber and Robillard was known to carry one, he was suspected from the beginning. He was trailed to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he was placed under arrest while sleeping in a hotel room. At first he den nied that he had killed Doran, stating that another man who he refused  to name had fired the shots. However, at his trial he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to die ih the gas chaMber. After his appeals had been denied, he calmly went to his death at San Quentin on April 26, 1961.

Finally Arnold persuaded Mrs. Armsby to cease giving him money and when Davis went to her house on January 6, 1891, and asked for more money to continue drinking, Arnold interfered and she refused him. Davis procured a shotgun and shortly after midnight returned to the house and demanded admittance into the bedroom shared by Mrs. Armsby and Arnold. When Arnold opened the door, Davis shot him in the face with the gun and Arnold managed to close it back and bolt it before he fell to the floor dead. Davis then shot the lock and the blast struck Mrs. Armsby who had raised to a sitting position in her bed and was in the line of fire, killing her He then went to the home of his sister where he was arrested shortly afterwards.

Garcia was tried and convicted three different times, The trail judge granted a new trial following the first trial be— cause of inaccuracies in the transcript and he ordered a new trial following the eecond conviction because of an insufficiency of evi; dence to sustain the verdict. At the third trial, the State had strengthened its case by recovining Wilkes' watch which Garcia had sold in'rrinidad and producing teetimony positively identifying it as the property of the nmrdered man and Garcia as the man who had “sold it.

He was raised by his mother who had a difficult time supporting him and her other children. Termed a sociapathiﬁ personality with a border—line intell- igence bordering on the mental defective, hewspent several years in a mental institution. After his release, he obtained employhent with a traveling cirCus and became an elephant trainer. On August 27, 1958, the circus was playing in the Denver Colosieum and Hammil struck up a conversation with llayear-old Lester Gordon Brown, Jr., and told him that if he would return that evening he would allow him to ride one of the elephants. When the little boy came, he brought a friend and Hammil took them inside the building. He asked Brown to go out with him for a few minutes and they walked a short distance from the cir~ tus. Hammil sexually assaulted the boy and when the child protested, : Hammil became afraid that he would report the incident and manually choked him to death. He then.went to a restaurant, ate and returned to the scene and buried the body in a sand pile. Hammil was arrested  essed and took olicemen to the place where he had Eﬂgiggxthgagcd§ganis plea was ong of insanity and two trials were        held. In the first, the jury ruled that he was sane and in the sec- end it convicted him of first degree murder and he was sentenced to die. The case was appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court, the main contention of the appeal being that there was not mm sufficient time between Hammil‘s decision to kill Brown and his actually doing so as to warrant deliberation because of the defendant's low mentalit and that he was , therefore, not guilty of first degree murder. The conviction was affirmed with one dissent on 'May 1, 1961.

He was indicted also for the murder of her young brother at the same time and place, but this casewas not brought to trial. The procession to the scaffold was a small one. First cane ""the warden of the jail. Beside him walked Robert Strong, a guard, who adjusted the rope about Schneider's neck, and who performed the same ""service for Guiteau. Then came Schneider, staggerihg and supported on either side by one of the guardsof the jail. Then came a minister, followed by two guards. ‘There was but a brief delay when the scaffold was reached. There was a brief prayer, the signal was given, the drOp fell, and Schneider, with the rope abouthis neck, fell half a dozen feet and all was over. The double murder which led Howard Schneider to the gallows was one of the most sensational brimes in the history of the District of Columbia. By reason of the previous respectability of the murderer, the standihg and wealth of his relatives, and the un- remitting efforts of his counsel and friends to save him from the gallows, the case attracted wide spread interest. In many of its surrounding circumstances, the case recalled that of Guiteau. One of the judges who participated.in the trial of the case, Judge Cox, was "" was the same one who tried Guiteau.

The victimes were Amanda Hamlink Schneider and her brother, Frank Hamlink. They were the son and daughter of Derrick E. Hamlink, a retired businessman of this city, and it was al- cat in front of their father's house that they met th.eir assassinatio on a public street. Because of his general worthless and vicious prop ensities, the young wife had separated from her husband, and the latte resorted to the pistol for'revenge. There is a general conviction that Schneider has been shamming insanity for many months. His actions at the last moments indicated that his mind was perfectly clear. Druing Schneider 5 last hours upon earth Rev. Parson and the colored evangelis Roberts, were with him. Roberts sang the hymn ""Jesus Save Me,"" and endeavored to have Schneider repeat the words after him, his efforts being crowned with some measure of success; The two men prayed ear— nestly and exhorted him in stirring words, but to the end their advan- ces were met in only a half-hearted manner.

Bacon had been seen rapidly riding the horse towards Augusta and the next day he was taken into custody and made a confession. The Superior Court was then in session and he was promptly indicted and placed on trial. His conviction was not appealed and he was sentenced to be hanged on the South Commons of Augusta on NOV. 29, 1872. @fter hlS conviction, he claimed that he had stnuck Martin over the head with a wagon standard after another man had told them that the Ku Klux had been looking for a blaCk man on Martin's farm and he became frightened andvqanted to renege on his work contract. However, he was converted to the Cattolic Church during the last week of his life and beforehis death he made another confession in which he said that robbery was his sole motive and that he had hired out to Martin totae able to rob him. He also said that he had not meant to kill the old man who had died two days after the assault without regaining consciousness. Between five and six thousand persons witnessed the execution and Bacon walked unassisted to the gallows, following the wagon carrying his coffin.  He displayed no nervousness except that his knees trembled slightly when the black cap was placed over his head.

From Savannah NEWS, Aug.aZi, 1856:The negro Bob, sentenced at the last term of our Supreme Court to be hung for the murder of Judge, a slave, suffered the extreme penalty of the law yesterday afternoon. The time appointed for the execution was 3 o'clock; but long before that time the square.in the rear of the jail, where the gallows was erected, was filled with a miscellaneous crowd, among which we were sorry to observ a large number of women. At 2:50, Bob was brought out of jail and con- ducted to the gallows. He ascended the ladder with a firmsatep,.and, after the fatal noose was placed round his neck, he stoood there with great composure during the performanceof the religious services. Aftei the singing of a hymn by the preachers of the colored Baptist congrega- tion, Rev. Mr. Neal read the appointed service. Two of the colored preachers then ascended the scaffold and stood there, whileBod address- ed the peOple. He said that he had looked forward to this day with desire, for duing his long imprisonment he had been led to reflect on his past life, had repented of his course, and was now ready to die. He warned all who heard him to beware of giving way to their passions, asit was this which had brought him to an untimely end. He concluded by saying that although he had led a wicked life, yet he indulged in a hope that his many sins had been forgiven through the merits of Jesus Christ, who he trusted would receive his spirit. Rev. John Cox, one of the colored preachers, then addressed a few rema.rks to the assem- blage, enforcing what Bob had said, and stating that he had been bap- tized, and as the thief on the cross was forgiven at the last hour, so he trusted it would with him who was so soon to leave this world. He clos ed with a brief and very appropriate prayer. Deputy Sheriff Buck- her then put the cap over Bob's face and adjusted the rope. The cler- gyman, the officers and his friends then took leave of him. Sheriff  . Cole asked him if he was ready to which he replied in a firm tone: 'Yes, Sir, all ready, goodbye.‘ The Sheriff cut the cord, the trap fell, and Bob had suffered the penalty of his crime. The fall was about.six feet, breaking his neck instantly. He died with scarcely a _ struggle. After hanging about to minutes, the body was pronounced lifeless by the attending physicians, and was cut down and delivered to his friends.” TIMES, New York, 8—27 1856 (6-1)|False|f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585

Between one and two o'clock on the afternoon of Dec. 28, 19h8, while she was walking with another womanxon Shorter Avenue in West Rome, Brock pedaled up to them on a biyycle and tried to talk with her. When she refused to have any discussion with him, he rode away but returned in a few minutes and asked her if she knew that KKXXﬁXK he was going to kill her. She replikd in the negative and he shot her with a shotgun. He then returned home and told.a neighbor what he had done. Shortly afterwards, he surrendered to the police. At his trial, he maintained.that his hind ""went blank"" when she refused to talk with him and that he had no recollection of killing her. A number of witnesses to the crime testified for the prosecution and the Court would not allow some defense witnesses who were non-expert  to testify as to his insanity. After his conviction without a reco- mmendation for mercy, the Supreme Court reversed it and ordered a  new trial on the grounds that the non-expert witnesses should have been allowed to give testimony as to his insanity and he was con- “mmmneanmtenced‘to mamma‘fagaintakén“ to the Georgia Supreme Court on the grounds that the trial court had. erred in refusing to instruct the jury on WW manslaughter, but the Court this time upheld the conviction, maintaining that there was not sufficient provocation for a manslaughter charge. Brock was enigeetrocuted at the Georgia State Prison on February 21, 1952. His last ‘words WERE were:""I'm at peace with the world and I‘ve given my heart back to God.

Dozier, alias John Dozier, was a young white man who lived for some time with an elderly and partially cprippled man named David.Gunn approximately one mile from the city limits of Columbus, Ga. In the fall of 185? he became infatuated with a woman named Elvira Wheeler and began paying the rent on another house nearby in which they lived together in a state of adultery even though they both expressed the determination to marry at some future date. On the evening of Sept. 11, 1857, Gunn was at the house which DoZier shared with Miss Wheeler and both men had been drinking. Gunn made some disparaging remarks about Dozier and Dozier reprimanded him for doing so. Gunn, one of whose arms was helpless, then struck DoZier and the two men went outside and Miss wheeler heard Gunn remark that he was dead. Shortly afterwards Dozier entered the house and stated that he be- lieved that Gunn was dead, giving his knife to the woman. Gunn was, indeed dead, his throat having been cut andhis body bearing other knife wounds. There were no other persons present at the time of the murder and Miss WhEeler appeared as a witness for the State at D0zier's trial where he was convicted and sentenced to die.

He and his wife, Daisy Moore Shaw, had never gotten along well and in 1873 he  was arrested on a charge of assault and battery for beating her. At that time he had told the justice of the peace that he felt that he had a right to beat his wife. On the night of April 29, 1877, they took their four-year-old child to the home Of’Xhl her mother who had never approved of Shaw for a visit. They quarreled from the time of their arrival until they left and Mrs. Meorex subsequently stated that she was apprehensive about her daughter's safety at the time. The next morning, they were quarreling in front of their hired man, Butler, when he left the house and went into the field to plow. Shortly afteru wards, Mrs. Shaw was shot in the head after she had previously been beaten with a stick of wood and her arm broken. Shaw took the child to the home of his mother-in-law and told her that his wife had been killed by two negro men. At his preliminary hearing, Butler testified that Shaw had been working in the field at the time the shot was fired but at his trial he said that he had left the couple a rguing in the house and that he“heard Mrs. Shaw beg her husband not to kill her just before the shot was fired. He said that Shaw then went into the field and admitted to him that he had killed his life and warned him on the penalty of death to say nothing about. Butler, of low mentality but considered truthful,«said«thatlhe_hadworiginallymlied—becauseshewwasww afraid and had decided to tell the truth only after he had moved away from the neighborhood.

'Shortly afterwards he and Miss Stewart left the tavern to walk to her home which was located at 501 Jones Avenue. They began arguing when Williams informed her that he did not have $16 which he had promised her for some glasses and when she informed him that she could obtain the money from Steed, he became enraged and beat her severely, bruis- ing and lacerating her face. After they reached her house, he left rand when Steed arrived in a taxi, she met him at the door and told him that she would be unable to keep their date as a result of the beating that she had received. While they were talking,’Williams  appeared out of the dark and she slammed the door. When Steed as him a preaching, he leaped from the porch and began running down t e stree screaming. The taxi driver, who he had instructed to wait, followed as Williams dhased Steed. Several ﬂﬂﬂii away, Steed ran on  block the porch of a house and began beating on the door and.begging adé mittance. Williams attacked him from behind and began stabbing him with a pocket knife. They fell from the porch to the ground and Williams continued his assault. When the taxi driver started to the assistance of Steed, Williams fled. Steed died in the cab enroute to the hospital and a sbusequent autopsy showed that he had been stabbed 17 times and died of internal hemmorhages. Williams was arrested at home the next morning and, at the time of his capture, he was in the process of packing a bag as though he planned to flee. At his trial, he maintained that he had not attacked Steed and had not been at 501 Jones Avenue when Steed arrived to take.Miss btewart to the nightclub even though he admitted having administered the heating to her. Both the taxi driver and Miss Stewart testified for the prosecution, placing him at the address and the taxi driver testified as to having witnessed the assault.

Around noon on Oct. h, 1952, he entered “Simon's Liquor Store at 295 Peters Street, SEQ Atlanta, with a drawn pistol and held up the clerk, 65-year-old Harry Furst. thile Furst was withdrawing $858 from the cash.register,\Williams shot him in the abdomen, inflicting a wound from.which Hurst nix was pronounced dead on arrival at an Atlanta hospital.“ Williams grabbed the money and ran from the shOp but was seen by Forst's enployer who was in the back of the building and a number of passers-by. He was not arrested until Oct. 17 when he was taken into custody after he had.pawned the murder weapon for $15. Williams made a confession in which he stated that, after he had shot Furst, he went to a dice game where he lost the pro— deeds of the robbery. At his trial, he was convicted and sentenced to die. His case was unsuccessfully appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court and his attorney then filed an extraordinary motion for a new trial. When this was denied by the trial court, this was also taken  to the State Su reme Court and then to the United.3tates Supreme Court on the argunds that the color of tickets used denoted the race  of the prospective jurors. While conceding that this prejudiced the case of ﬂilliams, the Court refused to set aside the conviction on the grounds that the objection had not been filed prior to the time that the trail began and remanded it to the Georgia State Supreme Court  for reconsideration.

Bilverstein, who lived in the rear of the building with his wife and two children, told them that he did not want to reopen the store and when they "" explained that they needed some sugar, he told them to go to the rear. After he had admitted them and they had walked through the living quarters into the store, Baxter bludgeoned him to death with a two foot length of iron pipe. He then bludgeoned Mrs. Silverstein and the two children, a lO~ year-old boy, leaders, and a h—year-old girl, unconsciou: aid he an: 1 - ' ' hdruoer and ransacked t e ouse. oar. ﬁgétﬁeigogogﬁgnggnﬁgsgrggggggegagonsciousness and etaggered from the rear door where she was seen by a neighbor who notified the police. Even though the lives of Mrs. Silverstein and the two children were all despaired sf, they finally recovered at St. Luke's Hsopital: Baxter and White were arrested, slang with Baxter’s Wife and White's girl- friend and another man at hOO Elm St, early on the morning of March 7 after the Sheriff and his deputies, whe had received a tip that Baxter and White had been seen leaving the:scene of the murder at about the time that it had occurred, surreunded the house.‘ Mrs. Silverstein and Isadore, bath of whom had regained consciousness, identified them from their hespital bed, and that night a mob marched on the jail to lynch the prisoners. The mob was finally dispersed and the next morn- ing'they were taken to Saint hugustine for safekeeping. Granted a change of venue, they were tried there, convicted and sentenced to  die. The evidence against Baxter was conclusive because, in addition to his having been identified, money wrapped in a piece of a St. Peters burg newspaper that matched a piece wrapped around the murder weapen which had been left in the store. was feund in his fohpecket. The cas: against White was mainly based on the fact that his girl friend testi— fied that he and Ehxter had left the house tegether and that when they returned Baxter had said that they had had a ""row"" with a man and  h d. Both defendants took the stand in his own hep ﬁglggdhglgtﬁndgggedeﬁaving left the house on the night of the murder.  Baxter also stated that he did not know how the money wrapped in the newspaper had gotten into his pocket. There was no appeal of the ‘  BAXTER ANDFWHITE, St. Augustine, F1a., Cbntinued.  convictions and they were hanged together with Steve Jehnsen, convicts of another murder, at St. Augustine at 11: 30 AM on May 31, 1912. All three of the condemned men mounted the scaffold singing hymns. Both Baxter and White denied any involvement in the Silverstein murder and “mite amplified his denial by blaming his predicament en the keeping of bad company, urging his listeners to shun'evil companiens.

He had recently purchased a cheap .25 caliber pistol and on the night of June 8, he decided to steal a chicken from the Loucakis' «chicken house. He arrived there around 11:30 and Mr. Loucakis had already gone to bed while Mrs. Loucakis was working at her desk counting their receipts and doing their books. Hasty peered in through a window just as she finished and rose to close the living room door and, fearing that she had seen him, he fired a shot throng} the window screen which struck her and infliced a fatal wound. Hasty fled, drapping a cigarette holder and his cigarettes. Mr. loucakis rushed his wife to a hOSpital where she died after stating that she did not know hho had shot her. Hasty's footprints, the impressions of which were found under the window, were followed to his home and he was arrested. His pistol was found under the mattress of his  bed and he admitted ownership of the cigarette holder and the ciga- rettes. At his trial, he claimed that he had the pistol in one hand as he opened the chicken house door and that it accidentally dis- charged. However, the prosecution showed powder burns on the soreen around the bullet hole that could have been there only if the gun had been fired from close range and the chicken house was 100 yards away. Hasty was convicted and when the Supreme Court of Florida to “which the case was appealed affirmed the verdict and sentence, he was electrocuted at the Floridatstate Prison at Raiford on Sept. 16,  1935. 162 SOUTHERN RECORDER 910|False|f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585

For several weeks, he had planned robbing dmith who he knew would be carrying a considerable sum of money on Nedenesdey nights. He enlisted four friends, John Bennett, Gus MbCloud, Robert Jennings and Jack Harvey to assist him in his plan and on the night of January 18, 1938, they drove out to the farm owned by Smith’s father-in-lew in.KhX Crystal Lake Drive and hid in the barn to await Smith's arrival. ﬁenderson was armed with a double-barrell shotgun while Bennett was armed with a single-barrell gun that Henderson furnished. When Smith entered the barn, Henderson shot him in the groin with a load of size 8 pelletts and then bludgeoned him over the head with the barrell of the gun that he was carrying. He gave his confedere tee some of the money that he took and drove them back to Urlando. All were subsequently arrested and there was a conflict of testimony as to whether the fetal shot had been fired by Bennett or by Henderson. All four of his accomplices testified against him- et his trial while Henderson denied that he had any part in the mur- der-robbery and sought to establish an alibi that was sUbstentiated only by his own relatives. After he had been convicted and sen- tenced to die, McCloud, Jennings and harvey were allowed to plead guilty to second degree murder charges and were sentenced to life imprisonment while Bennett, who pled guilty to first degree murder, received the same sentence. It should be emphasized that the main evidence against Henderson was that of his four accomplices, all of whom admitted that they were involved in the crime, and all of whom claimed that Henderson had threatened their lives if they ever re- lated what happened. The jury was enjoined by the trial judge to consider their evidence with caution, but it evidently believed that the subetentiating evidence was strong enough to warrant a conviction.

When he was 21—years-old he stabbed a men who he said had been annoying his sister in Troy, Ala. The man died and Powell was sentenced to 10 years in prison but his influential family managed ,tO get him paroled after one year. He then moved to Jacksonville, Fla., where he married Katharine Spear, the daughter of a wealthy widow, Mrs. LouiseSpeer. A few years later, in the course 66 an argument, he killed William T. Cowles, a Jacksonville attorney, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After spending a large part of her fortune, Mrs. Spear was able to get him released after he had served only three years of his sentence and he returned to Jackson- ville. A friend informed Powell that his wife planned to divorce him and arrange things where he could never receive any of her pro- perty. Though the friend's information was not based on fact, Powel believed him and on the night of March 2, 1936, he bludgeoned both Katharine and Mrs. Spear to death with a hammer. He drove the cor- pses to a creek in Nassau County, cut open the hbdomens which he weighted with rocks and threw them in. Then next day, he reported‘ both women missing and when officers went to his house, he invited them in and invited them to search the premises. At his invitation they also searched the garage. In addition to discovering blood- stains, they also found the rings and jewhlry that Powell claimed the two women had been wearing when they left the house on the night of their disappearance. The bodies floated to the surface and were discovered on March 6 and Powell's tire tracks matched some found  at the creek. He was arrested and charged with the two murders. In Spite of the overwhelming circumstantial evidence against him3 he denied his guilt but he was nonetheless convicted and sentenced to die. His sentence was appealed to the State Supreme Court on the grounds that the evidence obtained when the officers searched his house at his invitation was done so without a warrant, but the Court ruled that as he had given permission and even asked them to search a warrant was not necessary and they affirmed the lower Court; Powell was electrocuted at Raiford Prison on July 12, 1937.

Mrs. Thompson and one of her roomers, Joe Henry, a h3-year-cld engineer, planned to be married but her sons disapproeed and they and Heruy quarreled constantly. One night in January, l9hl, they had all been drinking and the brothers persuaded Herwy to go out with them in their automobile. They drove to a de- serted area of Duval Countr and bludgeoned Henry with an iron bar,  cut his throat with a knife and thréw his body into the headwaters of NineiMile Creek after reléiving it of all the money that Henry was carrying. They then returned home and attempted to remove the blood-‘ stains from the car. When Henry was found to be missing the brothers were taken into custody and they both confessed, directing officers to the location of the body. They maintained that the killing was unpre~ meditated and had occurred when they got into a fight over remarks that Henry had allegedly made concerning their mother. The State main—  tained that their hatred for Henry and robbery was the motive and Mrsn  Thompson testified against them at their trial where both were con- victed and sentenced to die. Their case was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court which affirmed the conviction. An effort was then.made to the State Pardons and Parole Board to obtain clemeuoy and they then maintained that they had killed Henny when he threatened their lives. Mrs. Thompson expereenced a reversal offeeling and pleaded with the board to Spare the lives of her sons but the Board refused to intervene and the brothers were electrocuted at the Florida State Prison on August 19, 19AM. Both met their dates in a composed manner and refused to make any statement.

Around 3:30 on the afternoon of Feb. 12, 1902, one day after he had be- gan serving his sentence, he and three other black prisoners were being returned to their cell in the county jail by deputy sheriff Gharlie Lane when Wilson attacked Lane from behind and he and another prisoner, Julius Goodwin, disarmed the deputy. They wanted to shoot Lane, but were dissauded ﬂrom doing so by the other prisoners who did not partici« pate in the escape and they fled from the jail and out through the stockade, locking the gate behind them. They ran into the home of Sheriff J. H. Lane which adjoined the jail and Wilson took a KKIKKEE Rx rifle from Mrs. Lane's hands. Two young mentrushed into the house on hearing her screams, and Wilson struck one of them over the head with the rifle and slashed him on the face with a knife while Goodwin forced the other to retire at the point of a pistol. Goodwin then  fled from.the house, firing at a pursues, and made his escape. 'Wilson remained in the house which was surrounded by‘a number of citizens of  Sumterville and when a 21-yeargold merchant, Lee Graham, atte‘ ted to enter the house, Wilson shot him, inflicting a wound.from whic Graham  died a few hours later. Wilson finally managed to leave the house and was not inmured by the shots that were fired at him. He made his way to Tampa and was not captured until March 27th when Queriff‘ tans 1e. cated him there and placed him under arrest. Because of the intensity of the feeling in Sumter County, he was held in the Tampajail until April lst when he was returned to Sumterville and tried at a special term of court, convicted and sentenced to die. During the trial which‘ lasted for“one7half day, Wilson took the stand in his own defense and claimed that Goodwin and not he had fired the shot that killed Graham. Immediately after the trial, a man took the transcript of the record to Tallahassee to ask Governor Jennings to sign a death warrant as quickly as possible. The Governor was in St. Augustine and.the man went there and presented.thepapers. The Governor promptly signed the warrant and the man returned to ﬁumterville where at 1:30 on the after- noon of April h, 1902, Wilson was hanged behind an enclosure around the jail yard.

In October, 1897, they had a falling out and Irie forbid him to come to their house again because he had heard that Yoshida had been spreading false stories to the effect that Oyasu had been steal- ing rice. On Nov. 3, 1897, the Emperor of Japan's birthday, the Japanese community celebrated by drinking saki. Early the next morn- ing Irie left ﬂor work as usual. Around six e'clock, Yoshida went to a store and purchased a strong jack knife. He then went to Irie's house where Oyasu was working in the yard. They were seen talking and suddenly Yoshida drew the knife and began stabbing her. Two other Japanese ran to her resnue, but by the time they h: arriVed, he had already inflicted fatal wounds. At his trial, Yoshida claimed to have been drinking and attempted to prove intoxication but was unable to do so when the storekeeper who had sold him the knife, the wit— nesses who had gone to assist Oyasu, and the physician who examined him immediately after the trial all testified that he was sober.

In April, lBhS, an elderly German couple, John Miller and his wife, with their daughter and her husband, a man named Leiey, moved into a small cabin near West Point, Iowa. They had in their possession $5,000 and stated that they planned to buy a farm and settle there. Late on the a fear- noon of May 10, the Hodges and another man who was never identified appeared and asked if the settlers had Seen anything of some lost oxen. Later in the night after’the Millers and the Leicys had re- tired, they three strangers burst into the cabin and attacked the  two men, both of whqm resisted. 'Miller and Leicy were KIEK beaten, stabbed repeatedly and shot, the old man dying that night. The bro- thers were traced by a fur cap that William Hodges had dropped in their flight and warrents were issued for their arrest. Much to their -surprise, the leader of the Mermon Church, Brigham leung, permitted the warrents to be served and they were returned to wess Point where the mortally wounded Leicy identified both of them before he finally died from his wounds. They were convicted of the killings and both w ere hanged near West Point on July 15, 18h5. Both protested their innocence until the end, but there can be little doubt as to their actual guilt as many witnesses saw them in the néighborhood'on the day of the crime and Leicy's deathbed identification was made when the brothers were presented to him in company with several other  men of.£KX similar size and charaﬁteristics. rhe third.man was never positively identified.

During the First Ebrld War, he served in the U. 3. Army in France and after his return from the service he settled in Gowrie, webster 00., Iowa, where he worked as a fa rm laborer. For many years, he was employed by William Lennox, a pros— perous dairy farmer who lived about four miles from Gowrie and during  subsequently married a farmer named Everett Warden. When Mr. and Mrs. Lennox died, the Vardens took over the farm and Jarrett remained in their employ for aboutVtwo years but finally quit because me did not like Mr. warden. He moved tn tawn'where he lived in an aba ndon~ ed store building. On the evening of Jan. 11, l9hh, he walked out to the warden farm and hid in the garage, waiting for the return of the Wardens who had gone to Gowrie to make a milk delivery. Mr; Twarden dropped his wife off at the house, drove his car into the garage and when he emerged, Jarrett attacked him with a 30 pound iron bar and bludgeoned him to dea th. He then went to the house and struck Mrs. arden over the head with a revolver and bound her with some twine. He thought'that she was unconscious and stepped outsided to turn off the outside lights. She managed to free herself and escaped frdm a bedroom window. She fled across some fields to the home of a neighbor where she gave the alarm. When Jarrett saw that she had escaped, he returned to the store building where he was staying and lay down.  When the officers arrived at the farm, they found warden unconscious and sent him to a hOSpital where he died several hours later. Jarrett was arrested at the store building and confessed, saying that he had an affection for Mrs. Warden but did not like her husband. He said that he intended Killing them and then himself. At his trial, he pleaded guilty and seemed indifferent to his fate. He was hanged at  the Iowa State Prison on February 23, l9h5, and went to his death with no show of emotion. ~ .

The slayer was locked up herefor safe keeping, as feeling runs high at/Ottumwa, the scene of varutal mur- ders recently; Junkin, in a confession here today, declared that he had deliberately planned to commit thecieed at Ottumwa while he was still an inmate of the Madison penitentiary, serving a term for robbin and beating a woman. It was his boast that he would 'again do the trick' if given a chance. He boasted of his ability to assault the defenseless women. This information.came in a letter from Albert Evans, a Missouri negro, who was a cell-mate with Junkin at Fort Madi» son. Junkin is guilty of more crimes, writes the negro Evans. He planned it while still in the penitentiary, and when he left knew it was his intention to 'pull off the stunt as soon as he had an oppor~ tunity.‘ Ebaas statement is given weight, owing to the fact that Junkin killed Miss Rosen just a few days after he had been released from prison. Junkin plans to stand trial. 'I was full of dope, I tel you; chuck full of it,‘ he moaned as he tossed about in his narrow bunk in the cage,.

O'CONNOR, Patrick ‘  O'Connor, 3 white man who had the reputation of a desperate charac- ter, was a business partner of George O'Keefe in the settlement at Dubuque Mines, now Dubuque, Iowa. The two men also jointly owned  a home in which both lived. On the night of May 29, 183h, O'Keefe and some of xxx his friends went there and found theihouse locked from the inside. when O'Co nnor refused to open the door, they kicked it down and as O'Keefe entered the house, O'Connor shot and killed him. At the time, this area was under no established legal jurisdicition and the next day it was decided by all concerned par- ties to establish a court and try O'Connor who had been promptly arrested. A jury of twelve men was empaneled and he was given the opportunity of Objecting to any whh he felt would not render him  a fair and impartial trial. He was also allowed to choose one of his friends as counsel. After the evidence had been presented, the l.jury'retired and deliberated for over two hours before returning a Verdict of guilty and recommending that O'Connor be hanged. At noon oﬁ June 20, 183h, he was taken from his place of confinement under  a guard of volunteers and escorted to the selected.plaoeloflexeoution.

Accordingly, O'Connor was taken to Dubuque, only a short distance away, where an impromptu trial was held Both the people and the defendant selected counsel who in turn sum~ moned from those present twenty-four men.

When they found some shot in the commode where Rhodes had discarded it after emptying the shell, they were certain that he had murdered his wife.

When the officers showed him a picture of his wife‘s mangled corpse,he confessed. Tried, convicted and sen- tenced to die, his execution was delayed while his attorneys appealed his case.

On October 27, 1880, he left Boise on the stage traveming the Overland Road.to Kelton, Utah, and continued on it until it overtook 60—year-old George Meyers, nikhxn a teamster with whom he was acquainted. McDonald left the stage and.got into Meyers wagon with the intention of their traveling together. A few days later, McDonald drove the wagon and team back to Boise alone, say— ing that he had purchased.them from Meyers. Suspicion that he might have murdered the teamster was aroused when he tried to claim a horse that Meyers had boarded with a friend. McDonald left town, but the suspicions were voiced.to the Sheriff and he followed McDonald to Di- toe's Station where he was arrested on Nov. 12 and returned to Boise. McDonald escaped jail in January but was recaptured ten days later and when Meyers' body was found hidden in a canyon near the line dividing Cassia and Owyhee Counties, it was necessary to have a surveyor run  a line to determine which County had jurisdiction. They surveyor‘s report indicated that Owyhee County was where the crime had occurred and McDonald was indicted and tried in Silver City where he maintained that Meyers had been accidentally trampled to death by horses. He was convicted and after his conviction had been unsuccessfully appealed.to the Idaho Supreme Court, he was hanged from a gallows constructed at the New York Mill, one mile below Silver City, on Oct. 1h, 1881. Prio to his death, he conceded that he had been present at Meyers' murder and helped to dispose of the body, but claimed that others had killed the old man.  1 PACIFIC 3115 ‘ IDAHO Till-WEEKLY STATESMAN, BOISE, 11-16—1880; 10-15488].  a”?

Pierson and an acquaintance John T. (Johnny-Behind—the-Rock) Hall decided to go into the saloon business in partnership. Their agreement called for Pier- son to provide a place for the business and fix it up while Hall was to provide the stock of goods. After Pierson had performed his part of the agreement, Hall told him.that he did not have the funds to furnish the stock and asked Pierson to buy it on credit which Pierson refused to do. The two men became bitter enemies and on several occasions Hallwent to the cabin and created a disturbance. On the morning of August 25, 1882, Pierson returned home and found that Hall had been there and severely beaten Banjo Nellie. He went to a Depu-  Eg Shgriff and asked that Hall be arrested and the Deputy advised him re urn home and protect his por erty.

Bell knew that Mrs. Briden kept a large sum of money in a tin can hidden in her home and, early in December, 1863, while she and her daughter were away from home, he broke into the house and stole the container and the money which he buried near» by. Mrs. Briden promptly accused him of the crime and on Thoember 22, 1863, he killed her by crushing her skull with an axe and slittin her throat with a razor. Bell denied his guilt and while the evi- dence against him was wholly circumstantial, the prosecution proved his guilt to the satisfaction of the jury, maintaining that his dou- ble motive for the murder was revenge against the woman for inter- fering with his courtship and an attempt to avoid prosecution for the theft.

Without Speaking anword, Higgins drew a revolver and shot him through the breast, killing him instantly. About four hours later, policemen saw Higgins staggering along Jefferson Street in a drunken condition and took him into custody. He confessed shortly after- wards and again at the coroner's inquest but subsequently repudiated his confession, stating at his trial that it had been beaten from him. He was convicted and sentenced to die and, after appeals to the State Supreme Court and the Governor had been denied, he was hanged in the Cook County Jail in Chicago on March 23, 189h.

The Illinois Central Railroad had been granted land in the area which, contained some good timber and the local residents had, for some time, been in the habit of getting their fuel supplies from this timber.  The railroad hired a blacksmith, Plassibo Calhoun as a detective with instructions to report any thefts XﬂﬁXKKEXKXIKﬂﬂ from their prOperty and Calhoun promptly earned the enmity of his neighbors. He received an anonymous letter demanding that he leave the community and when he met William Grass hn the road, be accused the merchant of having written the letter. They got into an altercation during the course of which Grass was shot in the arm. Grass, his son Phillip, Meyers, ‘a newcomer to the area from Kentucky named Hubbard Holder and several others formed a group with the Xﬂidﬁﬁﬁ avowed intention of getting rid of Calhoun. On the night of April 12, 1868, they met, got liquor: ed up and went to the Calhoun home for the purpose of setting fire to 3151331595 ﬁngighggr gillﬁggi€a% ggugaggfgghetgrgeréggefaggb lest t‘mglgf {'3 e inharn to burniand they returned to them one o~wone of the conspiratorS'  whete they drank until morning and then went back to Calhoun's. The rain had stopped and they managed to get the fire started. When Cal- houn ran from his house, Meyers shot and killed him. All of the mem— bers of the mob went to Missouri where they remained for some time before returning to Shelby County. Several of them began bragging of their part in the affair and one of the fringe members of the group, a man named Moore,.Iﬂiﬁﬁﬁ confessed and turned State's Evidence against the rest. ﬁMeyers and Holder were sentenced to hang while Phillip Grassreceived a-life sentence and William Grass was sentenced to 20-years in priSon. A few days before the execution, Holder's senu tence was commuted by the Governor and he was taken to Joliet Prison where he went insane and subsequently died. The people were indig- nant because Holder was spared and a riot was narrowly averted be- 'vause they felt thatﬁii Meyers should also be spared. He was hanged on a gallows in the yard of the jail at Shelbyville on July 30, 1670. He made a short speech to the large crowd which had assembled and which was held at bay by a guard of no veterans of the Mexican war in which he said that ﬁclder’s sentence should have been commuted as  he alone had fired the fatal shot and he declared that he wanted to die an honorable man.

After stealing some jewelry, he returned to Illinois, stepping at Delavan. 1here he heard that a farmer named George ML Orendorff who lived about four miles southeast of Delavan was considered wealthy and kept large sums of money at his home. On the morning of Oct. 12, 1860, eXpecting noone to be at home, but.prepared to kill if they were, he went to the Orendorff residence. He found Mrs. Orendorff and her two daughters, 9-year-old Emma and 7-year-old Ada at the house. Using a club that he was carrying, he beat Mrs. Orendorff and Emma senseless in the house and then ran outside and did the same to Ada. He then carried the child's unconscious body into the house, laid it on the floor with those of her mother and sister and used an ax to kill them all. After stealing all of the money that he Could find in the house, he fled. Orendorff returned home that night to find his“wife and one daughter dead and the other child dying. Ott,  who was a stranger in the area, was immediately suspected and he was  tracked to Lincoln where he was found hiding in a shock of corn. ' He was returned to Delavan where a determined crowd wanted to lynch him but, primarily becauseof the pleas of Mr. Orendorff, he was turned over to the Civil authorities to stand.tria1. At his arraignment, he pleaded guilty and he was sentenced to hang. The people wanted a pub- lic execution and applied to the Legislature to allow this but no ac- tion was taken.

At the times when they were seen together, Legree was walking while Thomason was riding a horse. The next day, Legree's rebbed and murdered body was found near the road about 18 miles south of Chicago. Thomason was soon arrested and identified as the man seen traveling with Iegree. At the time of his arrest, he gave his name as Morris and he was carry~ ing a pocket knife known to have belonged to Legree. Public feeling in Cook County was great against him and he was granted a change of venue to Iroquois County where, after being refused a continuance, he was placed on trial in May . At his trial, which,ﬁKK in the abs- ence of a Court House, was held in the house of a man named Richard Montgomery at Bunkum, he gave his name as Norris, but persons who knew him identified him as Thomason. The evidence against him was purely circumstantial but he was convicted and sentenced to die. He wasichained in a house at Bunkum until June 10, 1836, when he was dr van in a wagon, calmly smoking a cigar, to a walnut tree on the banks of the Iroquois River. In spite of the fact t; .r     gme day was storming, a large crowd of people gathered to witness the hanging. Thomason was allowed to make a short speech in which he attempted to justify his past life and thence rape was tied about his neck, the other and fastened to a limb of the(tree and the wagon driven from under him. ‘  Beckwith's HISTORY OF IROQUOIS CbUNTY, ILLINOIS.

In 1830, while  in such a Spell of madness, he cut off the head of a 9-year-old orphan girl, Catherine Muckeroy, who his brother had obtained from  a poor house to be a domestic servant.

Comer claimed that the bell was one of his and Herring took offense, using such abusive language that the Gamers started to leave for their home. Before Comer reached the fence around the yard, Herring shot him down. He then reloaded the gun and stood guard over the corpse for some time, refusing to let it be moved, or even to allow anyone to come near it. Finally,  he walked away of his own accord. His defense was one of insanity and his conduct at the time of the trial as well as on the occasion of the murder, coupled with eveidence of insanity in his family, led many to believe that he was, in fact, crazy.

Hubbard, an IiEKXKXKE itinerant and.impcverished white man, his wife and their idiot sonarrived in wabash 00., Ind., and in lBSh and arranged to live at the cabin of Aaron French, his wife and their five children. The Frenchs, though honest and upright people, were just as poor as the Hubbards. In early Octdber, 185h, French was seriously ill and told a neighbor who came to call that if he would sell what little personal possessions he owned, he would move with his family to a warmer'climate. When the man returned a few days later, the Hubbards were there alone and they«told him that they had purchased the French's belongings and that the family had moved to Iowa. The next spring, the body of Edward Boyle, a railroad Werkman who had boarded with the Hubbards and who was known to possess sever- al hundred dollars in silver and gold was found in a canal and Hr. and Mrs. Hubbard were taken into custody for questioning. A search party went out to the cabin to see if they could uncover Boyleis money and when they entered it, they immediately detected the smell  of decaying flesh. They removed the floor boards and, underenath 8 inches of d h v  the five children, all of when had been cruelly murdered. It appeared'that all except Mrs. French had been killed while sleeping, but evidence indicated that she had waged a fight for her life. Because the evidence in the French case was more positive, both Hubbard and his wife_were indicted for the murder of Aaron French. Tried first, Hubbard, who maintained his innocence was convicted and sentenced to hang. He was executed.in Wabash on Dec. 13, 18550 Mrs. XXKﬁEKXﬁXKXKKIKE Hubbard was tried the next year, convicted and sentenced to prison for life.

On May 16, lBhO, he and a number of other men had gathered in Rochester and ﬁKﬁXﬁKX were passing the day drinking poor whiskey and shooting at marks. He got into an argument with  a small Irishman named XXXKﬁKXE John Farley and they came to blows. Farley was no match for Lechner so he ran. Lechner fired a rifle at him but apparently did not take serioys XXXXX aim. Farley then climbed on a fence and made some taunting remarks at Lechnerx who took another rifle from his nephew, aimed carefullr and killed Far- ley. He was immediately arrested and charged with the crime. Con-  victed and sentenced to die, he was hanged on Nov. 3, lShO, about one-half mile west of Augusta.  COUNTIES OF LaGRANGE AND NOBLE, IND.

Early in 1878 he was sued for bastardy by a woman named Julia with whom he had been having an affair for several years and, to compromise the suit, he married her. Merrick made no secret of his dislike of this arrangement and.his hatred of the woman who had forced it upon him and he was heard to threaten to kill her on several occasions. Around eight o'clock on the night of Sept. 1h, 1878, when her confinement was due at any time, he persuaded her to accompany him on a buggy ride from which he returned alone. On Sept. 22, her nude body and.that of a newly born infant were found by two fishermen among some logs and brush near the bridge of the Morris St. extension and the body was quickly identified as that of Mrs. Merrick. The baby had been surgically removed from her wound.KX£Xi ﬁﬁﬁ while she was in her death agonies from the administration of strychnine. Merrick, who denied that the body was that of his wife, was arrested and charged with the murder. At his trial a druggist  testified that he had.purchased ten chnts worth of strychnine on Sept.13 and a saloon keeper whose business was near the SEot where the body was found testified that on the evening of Mrs. errick s disappearance he had sold Merrick two glasses of whiskey for himself  and a glass of blackberry wine for his wife who was in a buggy. Both he and a customer testified that they had seen Merrick pour some powder into the wine and give it to the woman in the buggy.  The prosecution also showed that Merrick was having an incestuous affair with his nieﬂhe at the time of his wife's death. Merrick‘s defense was that the body was not that of his wife. He said that he was in the habit ofarenting buggies to some ressurectionists whose names W he did not know and he sought to show that the bodies were those of victims of a grave robbing expedition. Iis conviction was appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court on several grounds, the primary ones being that the indictment was faulty  in that it did not specifically state that Julia was ""a human being"" and that it charged. him with murder both by poisoning and by a sur— gical Operation. The conviction was affirmed and Merrick was hang ed in Indianapolis on January 29, 1879. He went to his death still maintaining that the body was not that of his wife and his“, last words were: ""When that drop falls and my life goes Out, may peace be still: I wish to say no more.

The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial and while the proshcution presented expert testhmcny that she was dead before her body was consigned to the well, Sumner's attorneys claimed that she had either fallen into or committed suicide by jumping into it and drewning. ~The first jury'was unable to agree and he was tried for the second time, convicted and sentenced to die. This conviction was overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court on the grounds that the trial judge had failed to instruct the jury that the defendant did not need to disprove circumstances proved before them and that such failure could not be held against him unless it was shown that he  had the means in his power to diapers him. A third trial was held where he was once again convicted and sentenced to die. On Oct. 7, 181a, he was hanged from a scaffold erected on a hill just nérth of Brownstown, Ind. He protested his innocence until the last.  HISTORY OF JACKSON COUNTY, INDIANA. Published, 1886. Pages 575., S76 ' i V"|False|f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585
