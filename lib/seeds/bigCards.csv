M. Chateau. Leahy, who was single, became infatuated with Mrs” Chateau, the mother of a 17~ year-old daughter, and they began having an affair. When Chateau found out that his wife was seeing Leahy without his knowledge, he confronted her and told her that she would have to make a choice be- tween him and Leahy. She decided to stay with Chateau and when she told Leahy, he begged her to elepe with him: which she refused to do. He returned on May 9 and again asked her to run away with hbm warning her that, if she did not, he would ""take her support away."" She still refused to leave and early the next morning Leahy went to the Chateau home and hid in the woodshed. When Mr. Chateau went  out around 6 o'clock to get some wood, Leahy emerged and shot him. Chateau ran and Leahy chased him with an axe, striking him several times until a neighbor intervened and, at the point of a shotgun, marched Leahy in town and turned him over to a constable.

One day in the early 1830's when the Comers were visiting the Herrings, Herring diSplayed a cow bell which he had found. Comer claimed that the bell was one of his and Herring took offense, using such abusive language that the Gamers started to leave for their home. Before Comer reached the fence around the yard, Herring shot him down. He then reloaded the gun and stood guard over the corpse for some time, refusing to let it be moved, or even to allow anyone to come near it. Finally,  he walked away of his own accord. His defense was one of insanity and his conduct at the time of the trial as well as on the occasion of the murder, coupled with eveidence of insanity in his family, led many to believe that he was, in fact, crazy. Nonetheless, he was con- victed and sentenced to die. He was hanged at Columbus, Ind., on June ll, 1833. He appeared stolidly indifferent at his execution.
